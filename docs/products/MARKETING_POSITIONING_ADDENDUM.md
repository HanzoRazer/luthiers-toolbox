# MARKETING & POSITIONING ADDENDUM  
Version 1.0 — 2025–2026

---

## 1. HIGH-LEVEL POSITIONING STATEMENT

Luthier's ToolBox is a multi-tier ecosystem designed for guitar makers of all skill levels — from hobbyists designing their first custom guitar to professional shops running CNC-driven workflows.

Each product is positioned deliberately to create a self-sustaining ladder:

- **Express** attracts the largest audience  
- **Pro** converts builders into paying users  
- **Enterprise** transforms shops into businesses  
- **Parametric apps** capture Etsy/Gumroad markets  
- **Breakout creators** build brand dominance across niches  

---

## 2. TARGET AUDIENCES

### Express Edition
- Guitar players  
- Hobby builders  
- Students  
- CNC beginners  
- DIY modders  

### Pro Edition
- Luthiers  
- Woodworkers  
- CNC shops  
- Makerspaces  

### Enterprise Edition
- Boutique guitar companies  
- Multi-machine workshops  
- Semi-production environments  

### Digital Packs (Etsy/Gumroad)
- Laser cutter owners  
- Hobby CNC users

---

## 3. PRICING AS POSITIONING

| Tier | Price | Perception |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Express | $49 | Accessible, hobbyist-friendly |
| Pro | $299–$399 | Serious tool for serious builders |
| Enterprise | $899–$1299 | Business-grade, operational backbone |
| Micro-products | $12–$79 | High impulse-buy conversion |

This pricing establishes **clear value separation** while maximizing:

- Funnel entry  
- Mid-tier revenue  
- High-end enterprise sales  
- Passive income via digital products  

---

## 4. MESSAGING PILLARS

### Express
> "Design your dream guitar — no CAD skills needed."

### Pro
> "Your CNC-ready luthiery workstation."

### Enterprise
> "Turn your custom shop into a guitar factory — without losing the soul."

### Etsy/Gumroad
> "Accurate, ready-to-cut templates for real builders."

---

## 5. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

- No one else has an integrated luthiery OS  
- Competitors have fragmented tools  
- Nobody delivers parametric design + CAM + business suite  
- Etsy competitors are low-quality and non-parametric  
- CAM competitors are general-purpose, not luthiery-specific  

---

## 6. MARKET CAPTURE STRATEGY

1. **Launch Express** → increase footprint  
2. **Release Etsy packs** → generate passive revenue  
3. **Release Pro** → build authority  
4. **Release Parametric/Neck apps** → dominate niche marketplaces  
5. **Launch Enterprise** → capture B2B revenue streams  

---

### Market Validation
- Beta users already requesting Express-level tools
- Etsy market proven (competitors with 10K+ sales)

- Enterprise demand confirmed via shop consultations

### Financial Risk
- Low overhead (solo dev, no physical inventory)

- Multiple revenue streams (reduces single-channel risk)

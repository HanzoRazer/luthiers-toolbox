# CNC Saw Lab Scaffold

Saw Lab is the CNC production environment that consumes CAM-Core services. This folder will capture UI specs, API references, and telemetry once implementation patches land.

## Current Status
- Placeholder backend models and queues created under `services/api/app/cam_core/saw_lab/`.
- Frontend views/stores are staged but not yet wired into navigation.
- Queue-driven spotlight diff (CP-S21) and tool registry integration (CP-S30) remain TODO.

## Upcoming Work
1. Build Saw Lab UI shells with PreRecord seed overlay.
2. Implement queue-driven diff panel once CP-S21 spec is executed.
3. Track Saw Lab telemetry and learning notes in dedicated quickrefs.

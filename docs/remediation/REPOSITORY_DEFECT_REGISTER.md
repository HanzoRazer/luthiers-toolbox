# BR-001 — Repository Defect Register

> **Only currently verified defects.** No enhancements, no speculative concerns, no unavailable
> research. Every entry links to its [adjudication ledger](BACKLOG_ADJUDICATION_LEDGER.md) record and
> carries current reproduction evidence (charter §4.6). Populated in Commit 3.

## What qualifies as a defect here

Implemented or promised behavior that is **incorrect, broken, unsafe, or inconsistent with its
governing contract** — and can be reproduced **now** (failing test / deterministic command / traceable
code-path inspection / contract mismatch / documented runtime observation / explicit evidence that a
promised implementation is absent).

- A missing capability that was never approved is **not** a defect → `ENHANCEMENT`.
- Authorized-but-incomplete work is **not** a defect → `UNFINISHED_SPRINT_WORK`.
- A historical defect that cannot be reproduced now → `STALE_OR_NOT_REPRODUCIBLE` (not listed here).

## Register

_(No verified defects recorded yet — populated in Commit 3. An item enters here only with a current
reproduction basis; without one it stays `STALE_OR_NOT_REPRODUCIBLE` or `OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED` in
the adjudication ledger and does not appear here.)_

## Tips for Great Interviews

✅ **DO:**
- Ask open-ended questions ("Tell me about..." not "Do you like...?")
- Listen 80%, talk 20%
- Probe deeper: "Why?" "Can you tell me more?" "Show me an example?"
- Take notes on tone/emotion, not just words
- Stay neutral—don't defend your product

❌ **DON'T:**
- Lead the witness: "You'd love this feature, right?"
- Interrupt or finish their sentences
- Explain too much—let them explore the tool
- Argue or get defensive about criticism
- Promise features you can't deliver

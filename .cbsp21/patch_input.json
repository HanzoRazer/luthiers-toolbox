  "title": "Disabled Tooltip Reason + Correct Hotkeys",

      "Added computed import to Vue imports",
      "Created undoTitle computed property that returns helpful message based on historyStack state",

      "Updated Undo button :title from inline ternary to :title='undoTitle'",
      "Updated Redo button :title from inline ternary to :title='redoTitle'",
      "Disabled state now shows: 'Nothing to undo yet (Ctrl/Cmd+Z)' instead of 'Undo is unavailable (no edits to undo)'",
      "Disabled state now shows: 'Nothing to redo yet (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z)' instead of 'Redo is unavailable (nothing to redo)'",
      "Enabled states show clearer action descriptions with consistent hotkey format"
    ],
    "why_not_redundant": "Previous implementation used inline ternary expressions in template with less helpful messages. New implementation uses computed properties (better reactivity) and provides clearer disabled-state messages ('Nothing to undo yet' vs 'Undo is unavailable'). Also standardizes hotkey format to 'Ctrl/Cmd+Z' pattern."

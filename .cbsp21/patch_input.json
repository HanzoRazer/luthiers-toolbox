      "Added 'Reset tips' button in toolbar after Redo button (lines 83-91)",

      "resetTips() includes future-proof comment for additional tip keys",
      "resetTips() has try/catch error handling for localStorage failures",
      "Added .reset-tips-btn CSS styles (lines 659-670)",
      "Button styled as utility control: smaller font (10px), subtle colors, auto margin-left"
    ],
    "why_not_redundant": "Previous bundles (32.4.16, 32.4.17) added hint cooldown mechanism but provided no UI to manually reset it. Users who dismiss hints cannot easily re-enable them without waiting 10 minutes or manually opening browser dev tools. This adds explicit user control via a toolbar button, completing the hint system's UX loop."

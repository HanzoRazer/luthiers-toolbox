    "why_not_redundant": "Before: Hint only showed once when history first became available (Bundle 32.4.15). After: Hint can be re-triggered by hovering History header or '1–5' chip. Implementation adds interactivity missing from previous bundles. Uses event emission pattern (hoverHint) not present in codebase before. Provides user-initiated hint recall without requiring full history actions."

# Alternate Picking Fundamentals

## Overview
Alternate picking (down-up-down-up) is essential for speed and efficiency.

## Technique

1. Hold the pick firmly but relaxed
2. Use wrist motion, not arm
3. Keep pick angle consistent
4. Minimize pick travel distance

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Single String
On the open E string:
- Down-up-down-up at 60 BPM
- Increase by 5 BPM when comfortable
- Target: 120 BPM

### Exercise 2: String Crossing
Alternate between E and A strings:
- Down on E, up on A
- Maintain even rhythm

## Metrics to Track
- Timing consistency
- String noise (unwanted sounds)
- Pick attack evenness

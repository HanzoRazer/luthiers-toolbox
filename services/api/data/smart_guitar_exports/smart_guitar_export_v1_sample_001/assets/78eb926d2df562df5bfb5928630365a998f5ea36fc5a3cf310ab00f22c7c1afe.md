# Clean Fretting Basics

## Overview
Clean fretting is the foundation of good guitar technique. This lesson covers the essentials.

## Key Points

1. **Finger Placement**: Place your finger just behind the fret, not on top of it
2. **Pressure**: Apply firm, consistent pressure - enough to sound the note clearly
3. **Thumb Position**: Keep your thumb centered on the back of the neck

## Exercise

Practice fretting each note on the first four frets of each string:
- Start slowly (60 BPM)
- Listen for buzz or muted notes
- Adjust pressure and placement as needed

## Common Mistakes

- Pressing too hard (causes sharp pitch)
- Finger too far from fret (causes buzz)
- Collapsing finger joints

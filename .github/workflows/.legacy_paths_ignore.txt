# Bundle 14: Temporary allowlist while migrating workflow URLs to /api/*
# 
# Formats allowed:
#   - .github/workflows/file.yml           (ignore entire file)
#   - .github/workflows/file.yml:123       (ignore specific line)
#
# Remove entries as workflows are migrated to canonical /api/... paths.
# Goal: reduce this list to zero.

# --- Initial migration allowlist (2026-01-02) ---
